While this is a bit of an older message, [Configuration Manager 2409](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2409) has been released as a new build.

This build from Configuration Manager now has some security SQL changes, and some CMG updates. 

This post is largely a test to validate the build process now works as intended.
